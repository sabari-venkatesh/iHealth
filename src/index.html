      <p>This application consumes physical activity data, such as human heart rate, temperature, orientation or cceleration, in real time on a patient. It then streams and evaluates this data to produce statistics, detect what type of physical activity a patient is doing, and then detect or predict anomalies in a patient’s heart rate.</p>
